# ABSTRACT (English Version)

## Building a Lucky Vicky Thought Generator with Hugging Face

This project explores the development of an AI-powered positive thinking generation system using the Hugging Face Inference API. Centered on the concept of "Lucky Vicky Thinking," the application intelligently reframes negative events into positive experiences through advanced natural language processing.

### Technical Implementation

The project integrates multiple state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including Meta Llama 3.2 series and Microsoft Phi-3, delivered through the Hugging Face Inference API. The system supports dual deployment modes—local Windows environment and Jupyter Notebook—with comprehensive Token authentication and error handling mechanisms. To enhance user experience, the project employs the Gradio framework to create an interactive web interface featuring model selection, real-time generation, and result visualization.

### Key Achievements

The project successfully delivers: (1) Complete Hugging Face API integration with detailed configuration files and documentation; (2) Flexible multi-provider architecture supporting seamless switching between Hugging Face, Groq, and OpenAI; (3) User-friendly web application with intuitive interface and rich examples; (4) Robust error handling and troubleshooting mechanisms ensuring system stability.

### Application Value

This system demonstrates the application of advanced AI technology in mental health and positive psychology, providing users with an innovative tool to reframe negative experiences. The modular design and comprehensive documentation ensure excellent scalability and educational value, making it an ideal learning resource for AI application development.
